# Kickstarter Analysis

# Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

# Files
-The  Kickstarter Report is a Word Document with analysis describing the key findings from this project

-The Kickstarter Analysis is an Excel File that includes the Kickstarter data and the graphical and tabular portions of the analysis

# Objectives
This is an Excel Analysis and project report of four thousand past Kickstarter projects to uncover hidden trends by examining the funding process and success rate.


# Observation/Conclusions

From the dataset provided for this analysis, we notice that on average a Kickstarter project is most likely to be successful than to fail, in terms of comparison, there are 53.11% of successful projects and 37.19% of failed ones. If we take a further look at the specific categories, we realize that Theater, music, film and video are more successful than other categories such as journalism. In the sub-category we notice that plays stand out exponentially in terms of success. We also notice that the periods from May to July could be considered as hot seasons as campaigns during these seasons turn to have an increase in their success rate, while campaigns in December seem to be more unsuccessful.

# Limitations

-The dataset provided for this analysis might not give an accurate description of the Kickstarter. In the background information provided for analysis we are told only a third of all Kickstarter have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome, but we see in our analysis that there are more successful campaigns in comparison to failed or canceled ones.

-Also, we notice that the range of goals differ exponentially from each other in the study. Including campaigns with vey high goals and campaigns with smaller goals might not give us an accurate analysis as it might be easier to reach a smaller goal faster than it would be for a bigger one.

# Considerations

-A graph that analyses the correlation between the date created and the date completed for each project would help us understand the probability for a project to be successful or fail depending on the time frame. Projects with a longer durability might have more chances to attain their goals than projects with a shorter duration.

-Also, a graph that analyses the correlation between each country and the sum pledged to see which country has the highest amount of pledges, we can further analyze this in correlation to which category has the highest amount of pledges from each country.
