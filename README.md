# Kickstarter Analysis

# Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.

# Files
The  Kickstarter project report is a Word Document with analysis describing the key findings from this project
The Kickstarter Pivot Tables and Statistical Analysis is an Excel File that includes the Kickstarter data and the graphical and tabular portions of the analysis

# Objectives
This is an Excel Analysis and project report of four thousand past Kickstarter projects to uncover hidden trends by examining the funding process and success rate.


# Observation/Conclusions 


# Limitations

The dataset provided for this analysis might not give an accurate description of the Kickstarter. In the background information provided for analysis we are told only a third of all Kickstarter have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome, but we see in our analysis that there are more successful campaigns in comparison to failed or canceled ones.

Also, we notice that the range of goals differ exponentially from each other in the study. Including campaigns with vey high goals and campaigns with smaller goals might not give us an accurate analysis as it might be easier to reach a smaller goal faster than it would be for a bigger one.

# Considerations

A graph that analyses the correlation between the date created and the date completed for each project would help us understand the probability for a project to be successful or fail depending on the time frame. Projects with a longer durability might have more chances to attain their goals than projects with a shorter duration.

Also, a graph that analyses the correlation between each country and the sum pledged to see which country has the highest amount of pledges, we can further analyze this in correlation to which category has the highest amount of pledges from each country.
